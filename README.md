Quora is a website where people can post their questions and then those questions are answered by the others visiting Quora. It is a place to seek and share knowledge where you can ask anything about anything and invariably will find someone who will answer your question. Since the website is that flexible, it happens frequently that the same questions are asked multiple number of times. Over 100 million people visit the website every month.
Multiple questions with the same intent are a problem for both the seekers and writers. It is because people who are looking for answers will have to scan through all similar questions to find the best answer. Also the people who write answers to the questions will prefer to write their answers only once. It is hard for anyone to keep answering the same questions so long as people keep asking them again and again.
In this project, weâ€™re looking to explore different ways that this problem can be solved and see which features and models give us the best results.
